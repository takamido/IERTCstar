            @par Short description
            ERTConnect is a tree-based motion planner that leverages a prior
            experience to find similar motion plans. The provided experience
            is used to bias the sampling of candidate states, and their
            connections. ERTConnect grows two ERTs, one from the start and
            one from the goal, and attempts to connect them. A solution can
            also be found from an individual tree, as each exploits the
            experience differently.
